It doesn’t matter if you have one server or thousands. Deploying, configuring, and updating systems and their applications is drudgery.

Michael DeHaan started the Ansible project because he realized that past attempts to automate IT had only moved complexity into other areas.  Instead of making the lives of developers and sysadmins easier, we were now managing the management systems with a messy combination of custom code, heavyweight agents and point solutions.  And none of these tools were built for the cloud.  There had to be a simpler way.

Ansible makes deploying software fun again.

Ansible is a powerful automation engine that makes systems and applications simple to deploy.  No custom scripting or custom code. No agents.  All using an automation language that’s easy for anyone to understand and learn.  Just get in, get it done, and make some time for other strategic projects.
